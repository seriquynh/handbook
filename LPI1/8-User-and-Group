A User in Linux system has a unique ID.

- A User ID is a unique positive integer assigned by a Unix-like OS to a specific user. User name is only used for humans.
- In the Linux kernel 2.4 and older, UIDs are unsigned 32-bit integers that can be from 0 to 4,294,967,296.
- User root has UID is 0 (zero).
- UID and sone other information of a user is stored in `/etc/passwd` file.
- Normal users: Some Linux distributions use UIDs for non-privileged users starts at 100. Others, such as Red Hat, starts at 500, and still others, such Debian/CentOS, starts at 1000.

- UID and GID details can be found at `/etc/login.defs`. Here are id range of user, system user, group and system group.

```bash
UID_MIN 1000
UID_MAX 60000

SYS_UID_MIN 100
SYS_UID_MAX 999

GID_MIN 1000
GID_MAX 60000

SYS_GID_MIN 100
SYS_GID_MAX 999
```

- The default information of a local user when it's created stored in `/etc/default/useradd`:

```bash
useradd -D
cat /etc/default/useradd
```

- To know the supported shells in the system:

```bash

```

- `/etc/skel` contains files and directories that is copied to user home directory when it's created.cat
