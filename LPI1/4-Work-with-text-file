## Hard and Symbolic links

- Hard Link:
  - is a new file entry that refers to an existing file on the filesystem.
  - each file in a filesystem has at least on hard link by default.
  - to save space, instead of copying, lot of hard links refer to a file can be created.
  - all hard links pointing to the same file have the same permissions, link count, user/group ownerships, time stamps, and file content
  - hard links pointing to the same file content need to be on the same file system

- Soft Link (Symbolic Link):
  - is not a regular file, but a special type of file that points to an existing file or directory.
  - unlike hard links, soft links can point to a directory.
  - the target of a soft link points can be on a different file system.

```bash
ln myfile.txt myfile2.txt
ln -s myfile.txt myfile3.txt
```
