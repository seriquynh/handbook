## Setup Simple Linux Server

1. Create a new user for special purpose instead of using root.
2. Configure SSH connections (Eg. Prevent loging with password, deny login as root by password,...).
3. Secure network connections (Eg. Denny all but only accept a few ports,...) with iptables or firewalld.
4. Manage limit access with fail2ban.
