# My handbook for IT world

There are a few categories I am interested in. For each one, I read books, take notes and do exercises (or answer questions) here. They aren't completed and will be updated time by time.

- LPI1 (Linux Professional Institute)
- Operating System Concepts
- Design Patterns
- LazyToRead

## Book Recommendation

- [Linux commands Notes for Professional](https://books.goalkicker.com/LinuxBook/)
