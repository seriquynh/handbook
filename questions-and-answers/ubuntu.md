### What is a repository?

- A repository is a server containing a set of software that computer (Ubuntu OS) can download from and install them.
- There are five ubuntu repository categories: main, universe, multiverse, restricted and partner:
  - main: This contains free open source software, is fully supported by Ubuntu developers, is enabled by default.
  - universe: This is nearly similar to main but is maintained by the community.
  - multiverse: This doesn't contain only free open source software. You have to enable by yourself due to licensing and legal issues.
  - restricted: This consists of proprietary drivers.
- You can also add a third-party repository called ppa (personal package archive).
